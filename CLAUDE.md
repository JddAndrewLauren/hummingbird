Personal GTD-style task system. The task authority is moving from Linear
(org `twinion`, team `ION`) to an app-owned server (ADR-0008); the Linear
workspace stays the live working surface — and the skills below still target
it — until the owned stack is daily-usable. See `CONTEXT.md` for the domain
glossary.

## The sweeper

`sweep.py` is the one-way capture → Triage sweeper — one drain engine
over isolated adapters (Google Tasks fail-open, Gmail label-capture
fail-closed), the only built artifact of v0 capture. Stdlib-only Python,
one-shot, fired every 15 minutes by supercronic in a Fly worker. Its
invariants (one frozen namespace per source, create-in-authority-first
ordering, no Actions `schedule:`, no `[http_service]`) are load-bearing and
decided upstream; read `docs/sweeper.md` before touching any of them.
**Currently OFF (2026-08-08)** pending the authority move to the app-owned
server (ADR-0008); it retargets to `POST /api/items` when the owned stack is
daily-usable.

## The authority server

`server/` is the app-owned authority (ADR-0008/0009), its own Cargo
workspace: `domain` (the owned-schema types both sides will compile; the
client migrates onto them at S2/S3), `authority` (pure handler logic over a
sync `Sql` seam — plus an `Entropy` seam for token minting — fixture-tested
with rusqlite), `rules-engine` (fire-time evaluation of the ADR-0013
condition vocabulary, over the Event kind registry that lives in `domain`;
its `validate_rule` exists but is not yet wired into `POST /api/rules` —
`authority` does not depend on the crate — so a malformed condition is
currently caught only at fire time), and `worker` (the thin `workers-rs`
shim — one Worker, one SQLite-backed Durable Object). It carries the full
amended ADR-0009 schema plus the notification lane's
`rules`/`push_targets`/`deliveries` (14 tables,
`SCHEMA_VERSION 3`, ADR-0012/0013/0014), entity-level CAS writes (absolute
sets + `expected_version`, 409 carries the current entity, creates
idempotent by client id), the all-tables delta pull with `GET /api/sweep`
as its byte-identical backstop, bearer-token auth (sha256 at rest; scopes
`device`/`sweeper`/`ingest`; `/api/admin/tokens` gated by `ADMIN_SECRET`;
401 = bad credential, 403 = wrong scope or — for an `ingest` token, which is
bound to one alert source — a source mismatch, all empty-bodied), and the
`POST /api/alerts` ingest upsert. Still no production deploy (that is #95's
human gate H3) — `wrangler dev` + `server/scripts/smoke.sh` locally,
`.github/workflows/server.yml` in CI.

## The client sync engine

`client/core/src/sync/` is the device half of the owned stack (ADR-0008), and
the largest thing in `client/`: `adapter`/`transport` are the read side (the
normal pull is the delta since the mirror's own version; `GET /api/sweep` is
the correctness backstop, on app open and daily), `write/` is its mirror
image on the write side (CAS mutations, rebase-on-409, deterministic ids,
the error taxonomy), `mirror` is the local read model where absence demotes
rather than deletes (ADR-0003), `queue` is the durable FIFO plus its
dead-letter journal, and `cycle` is ADR-0007's one cycle — drain, then pull,
in that order, every time, with jittered backoff capped at five minutes.
**Durability belongs to the cycle, not the queue**: capture code calls
`SyncCycle::enqueue`/`run`, never `OutboundQueue::enqueue`/`drain` directly,
because only the cycle pairs each mutation with the snapshot write that
makes it durable before anything is sent. Clock, jitter and access token are
caller-injected on every call — bare `wasm32-unknown-unknown` has no clock or
RNG that does not panic. There is no `docs/sync.md`; the map is the module
docs in `client/core/src/sync/mod.rs` and each submodule's own header.

## The design system

The UI brand is the "Hummingbird Design System" project on claude.ai/design;
`.claude/skills/hummingbird-design/` is its repo-local mirror (tokens, the
16-component library, the web UI kit — sync record and what was deliberately
omitted in that directory's `github.md`). **All frontend/UI work must use
it: invoke `/hummingbird-design` before styling anything.** The web app
consumes it via `client/web/src/design/` (a copy of the tokens, with
`fonts.css` swapped to self-hosted `@font-face` because the production CSP
allows no Google Fonts) and `client/web/src/styles.css` (maps tokens onto
Tailwind utilities, dark mode on `[data-theme="dark"]`). When the design
project changes: re-pull the mirror first, then re-copy tokens into
`client/web/src/design/`.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues live as GitHub issues in `JddAndrewLauren/hummingbird`, driven via the `gh` CLI;
the wayfinder map is issue #1. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Default vocabulary — `needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`,
`wontfix`, plus the non-triage `plan` role. All exist on the tracker.
See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Microtasking

`/microtask <issue-id>` breaks one already-selected, stalled Linear issue into a checklist of
~2–5-minute Steps written into its body. See `.claude/skills/microtask/SKILL.md`.

### next-up-personal

`/next-up-personal` picks what to do right now from the Linear workspace — one ranked top
pick plus a health footer — and `/next-up-personal <issue-id>` hands one `agent`-labelled
issue to an agent. See `.claude/skills/next-up-personal/SKILL.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context — root `CONTEXT.md` glossary plus `docs/adr/`.
See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
