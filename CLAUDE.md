Personal GTD-style task system. The task authority is moving from Linear
(org `twinion`, team `ION`) to an app-owned server (ADR-0008); the Linear
workspace stays the live working surface — and the skills below still target
it — until the owned stack is daily-usable. See `CONTEXT.md` for the domain
glossary.

## The sweeper

`sweep.py` is the one-way capture → Triage sweeper — one drain engine
over isolated adapters (Google Tasks fail-open, Gmail label-capture
fail-closed), the only built artifact of v0 capture. Stdlib-only Python,
one-shot, fired every 15 minutes by supercronic in a Fly worker. Its
invariants (one frozen namespace per source, create-in-authority-first
ordering, no Actions `schedule:`, no `[http_service]`) are load-bearing and
decided upstream; read `docs/sweeper.md` before touching any of them.
**Currently OFF (2026-08-08)** pending the authority move to the app-owned
server (ADR-0008); it retargets to `POST /api/items` when the owned stack is
daily-usable.

## The authority server

`server/` is the app-owned authority (ADR-0008/0009), its own Cargo
workspace: `domain` (the owned-schema types both sides will compile; the
client migrates onto them at S2/S3), `authority` (pure handler logic over a
sync `Sql` seam — plus an `Entropy` seam for token minting — fixture-tested
with rusqlite), and `worker` (the thin `workers-rs` shim — one Worker, one
SQLite-backed Durable Object). It carries the full amended ADR-0009 schema
(11 tables, `SCHEMA_VERSION 2`), entity-level CAS writes (absolute sets +
`expected_version`, 409 carries the current entity, creates idempotent by
client id), the all-tables delta pull with `GET /api/sweep` as its
byte-identical backstop, bearer-token auth (sha256 at rest; scopes
`device`/`sweeper`/`ingest`; `/api/admin/tokens` gated by `ADMIN_SECRET`;
401 = bad credential, 403 = wrong scope, both empty-bodied), and the
`POST /api/alerts` ingest upsert. Still no production deploy (that is #95's
human gate H3) — `wrangler dev` + `server/scripts/smoke.sh` locally,
`.github/workflows/server.yml` in CI.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues live as GitHub issues in `JddAndrewLauren/hummingbird`, driven via the `gh` CLI;
the wayfinder map is issue #1. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Default vocabulary — `needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`,
`wontfix`, plus the non-triage `plan` role. All exist on the tracker.
See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Microtasking

`/microtask <issue-id>` breaks one already-selected, stalled Linear issue into a checklist of
~2–5-minute Steps written into its body. See `.claude/skills/microtask/SKILL.md`.

### next-up-personal

`/next-up-personal` picks what to do right now from the Linear workspace — one ranked top
pick plus a health footer — and `/next-up-personal <issue-id>` hands one `agent`-labelled
issue to an agent. See `.claude/skills/next-up-personal/SKILL.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context — root `CONTEXT.md` glossary plus `docs/adr/`.
See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
